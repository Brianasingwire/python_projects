## Overview

Password Generator is a simple and powerful tool designed to generate random and secure passwords for various security needs. Whether you are a developer looking to integrate password generation in your projects or simply a user who wants to enhance their personal account security, this tool is crafted to provide robust password options tailored to your requirements.

## Features

* **Customizable Password Length :** Users can specify the desired length of the password, allowing for flexibility depending on the security requirements of different platforms.
* **Inclusion of Character Types :** The password can include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, number and special characters to ensure complexity and compliance with most security guidelines.

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to select the password criteria:

1. **Length of the password :** The user specifies the desired length of characters.
2. **Character types :** Options to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

Basing on the user input, the script generates a password using a cryptographically secure random number generator, ensuring that each password is unique and secure.
